ChangeLog
=========

v1.10.0 / 2022-01-25
--------------------

* Build for macOS ARM64.
* Fix Go linting warnings and typos.
* Build with latest Go and dependencies.

v1.9.4 / 2019-11-08
-------------------

* Username and password from the environment were not being considered
  when the `~/.right_st.yml` file did not exist. They are now.

* Remove Slack notification from `.travis.yml`.

v1.9.3 / 2019-07-17
-------------------

* Fix an issue where trying to set the default MCI on a ServerTemplate would error with:

v1.9.2 / 2019-06-20
-------------------

* Fix [#68] where a new ServerTemplate upload in a new account would fail with a duplicate MCI attachment by changing
  to not using the dummy MCI if there are no existing MCIs on a ServerTemplate during upload and also creating a
  temporary dummy MCI rather than picking one that exists already in the account which is error prone in new or small
  accounts.
